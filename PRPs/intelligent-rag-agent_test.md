name: "Intelligent Multi-Modal RAG Agent with Knowledge Graph Integration"
description: "Comprehensive PRP for building a production-grade RAG agent that combines vector search, hybrid text search, and knowledge graph capabilities using PostgreSQL pgvector and Neo4j Graphiti"
---

## Purpose

Build an intelligent AI assistant that combines traditional RAG with knowledge graph capabilities to provide comprehensive insights. The agent leverages vector similarity search via PostgreSQL with pgvector, hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching with TSVector in PostgreSQL, and relationship-based reasoning through Neo4j with Graphiti. This creates a powerful multi-layered search system that understands semantic content, keyword relevance, and entity relationships for superior information retrieval and analysis.

## Core Principles

1. **Pydantic AI Best Practices**: Deep integration with Pydantic AI patterns for agent creation, tools, and structured outputs
2. **Type Safety First**: Leverage Pydantic AI's type-safe design and Pydantic validation throughout
3. **Context Engineering Integration**: Apply proven context engineering workflows to AI agent development
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Use TestModel and FunctionModel for thorough agent validation

## ⚠️ Implementation Guidelines: Don't Over-Engineer

**IMPORTANT**: Keep your agent implementation focused and practical. Don't build unnecessary complexity.

- ✅ **Start simple** - Build the minimum viable agent that meets requirements
- ✅ **Add tools incrementally** - Implement only what the agent needs to function
- ✅ **Follow main_agent_reference** - Use proven patterns, don't reinvent
- ✅ **Use string output by default** - Only add result_type when validation is required
- ✅ **Test early and often** - Use TestModel to validate as you build

### Key Question:
**"Does this agent really need this feature to accomplish its core purpose?"**

If the answer is no, don't build it. Keep it simple, focused, and functional.

---

## Goal

Create a production-ready RAG agent that seamlessly integrates three search modalities:
1. **Vector Search**: Pure semantic similarity using PostgreSQL pgvector
2. **Hybrid Search**: Combined semantic and keyword search using TSVector
3. **Knowledge Graph Search**: Entity relationships and temporal reasoning via Neo4j Graphiti

The agent should provide a conversational CLI interface that demonstrates tool call visibility, supports streaming responses, and maintains conversation context while leveraging the full power of multi-modal search.

## Why

Current RAG implementations are limited to single search modalities, missing the richness that comes from combining semantic understanding, keyword precision, and relationship reasoning. This agent addresses the need for:

- **Enhanced Retrieval Accuracy**: Multiple search strategies provide better recall and precision
- **Relationship Understanding**: Knowledge graphs reveal connections that vector search alone cannot capture
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Graph-based facts with validity periods enable historical query understanding
- **Production Readiness**: Full error handling, testing, and configuration management

## What

### Agent Type Classification
- [x] **Tool-Enabled Agent**: Agent with multiple search tool integration capabilities
- [x] **Workflow Agent**: Multi-step search processing and result synthesis
- [ ] **Chat Agent**: Conversational interface with memory and context
- [ ] **Structured Output Agent**: Complex data validation and formatting

### External Integrations

- [ ] REST API integrations

- [ ] Real-time data sources

### Success Criteria

- [x] Knowledge graph integration provides relationship and temporal query capabilities
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage with TestModel and FunctionModel validation
- [x] Security measures implemented (API keys, input validation, connection pooling)
- [x] Performance meets requirements (sub-second search response times)
- [x] CLI interface provides real-time streaming and tool call visibility

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Pydantic AI Agent Development

- ❌ Don't skip TestModel validation - Always test with TestModel during development and use FunctionModel for custom scenarios
- ❌ Don't hardcode model strings - Use get_llm_model() pattern with environment configuration
- ❌ Don't ignore async patterns - Maintain async/await consistency throughout agent and tool implementations
- ❌ Don't create overly complex tool chains - Keep tools focused on single responsibilities with clear error boundaries
- ❌ Don't skip dependency injection - Use dataclass dependencies with proper type hints and validation

### Multi-Modal Search Architecture

- ❌ Don't mix search result formats - Standardize response structures across all search modalities
- ❌ Don't ignore connection pooling - Use async connection pools for both PostgreSQL and Neo4j
- ❌ Don't hardcode search parameters - Make limits, weights, and thresholds configurable through dependencies
- ❌ Don't skip error handling in tools - Each tool should handle its own failures gracefully
- ❌ Don't forget embedding format conversion - PostgreSQL vectors require specific '[1.0,2.0,3.0]' formatting

### Database and Graph Integration

- ❌ Don't use string interpolation in SQL - Always use parameterized queries with asyncpg
- ❌ Don't initialize graph clients repeatedly - Use global instances with proper lifecycle management
- ❌ Don't ignore vector dimension validation - Ensure embedding dimensions match model specifications
- ❌ Don't skip index optimization - Use appropriate indexes for vector, text, and graph queries
- ❌ Don't forget cleanup - Implement proper connection and resource cleanup in CLI and testing

**RESEARCH STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED** - Comprehensive research conducted across all domains with working implementations identified and patterns documented.

## Confidence Score: 9/10

**Justification for High Confidence:**

1. **Complete RAG Pipeline Available**: The PRPs/examples/rag_pipeline directory contains a fully implemented, production-ready RAG pipeline with PostgreSQL pgvector, TSVector hybrid search, Neo4j Graphiti integration, and all supporting utilities.

2. **Proven Architecture Patterns**: The main_agent_reference provides battle-tested patterns for Pydantic AI agent development, including Rich CLI with streaming, pydantic-settings configuration, and proper tool integration.

3. **Comprehensive Research Completed**: Extensive research conducted using Archon MCP server for latest Pydantic AI documentation, web search for integration patterns, and analysis of existing working implementations.

4. **Clear Implementation Path**: The implementation plan provides specific, actionable steps that primarily involve integrating existing, working components rather than building from scratch.

5. **Thorough Testing Strategy**: Multiple validation levels using TestModel, FunctionModel, and integration testing ensure reliability and catch issues early.

6. **Production-Ready Security**: Security patterns researched and documented, including API key management, input validation, and connection pooling best practices.

7. **Multi-Modal Search Validated**: All three search modalities (vector, hybrid, graph) have been researched with working implementations and optimization strategies identified.

8. **Error Handling Patterns**: Comprehensive error handling strategies identified for database failures, graph initialization issues, and tool execution problems.

The only minor uncertainty (preventing 10/10) relates to potential version compatibility issues between the existing RAG pipeline components and the latest Pydantic AI patterns, but the research indicates these should be minimal and easily resolved during implementation.
