name: "RAG Knowledge Graph AI Assistant"
description: "Comprehensive PRP for building an intelligent AI assistant that combines traditional RAG with knowledge graph capabilities"
---

## Purpose

Build an intelligent AI assistant that combines traditional RAG with knowledge graph capabilities to provide comprehensive insights. The agent leverages vector similarity search via PostgreSQL with pgvector, hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching with TSVector in PostgreSQL, and relationship-based reasoning through Neo4j with Graphiti. This creates a powerful multi-layered search system that understands semantic content, keyword relevance, and entity relationships for superior information retrieval and analysis.

## Core Principles

1. **Pydantic AI Best Practices**: Deep integration with Pydantic AI patterns for agent creation, tools, and structured outputs
2. **Type Safety First**: Leverage Pydantic AI's type-safe design and Pydantic validation throughout
3. **Context Engineering Integration**: Apply proven context engineering workflows to AI agent development
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Use TestModel and FunctionModel for thorough agent validation

## ⚠️ Implementation Guidelines: Don't Over-Engineer

**IMPORTANT**: Keep your agent implementation focused and practical. Don't build unnecessary complexity.

- ✅ **Start simple** - Build the minimum viable agent that meets requirements
- ✅ **Add tools incrementally** - Implement only what the agent needs to function
- ✅ **Follow main_agent_reference** - Use proven patterns, don't reinvent
- ✅ **Use string output by default** - Only add result_type when validation is required
- ✅ **Test early and often** - Use TestModel to validate as you build

### Key Question:
**"Does this agent really need this feature to accomplish its core purpose?"**

If the answer is no, don't build it. Keep it simple, focused, and functional.

## Goal

Create an intelligent AI assistant that can:
1. Perform semantic vector search across document chunks using PostgreSQL pgvector
2. Execute hybrid search combining vector similarity with keyword matching via TSVector
3. Query knowledge graphs for entity relationships and temporal facts via Neo4j/Graphiti
4. Provide comprehensive search that runs vector and graph searches in parallel
5. Retrieve complete documents when full context is needed
6. Offer a conversational CLI interface with real-time streaming

## Why

Current RAG systems often lack the ability to understand complex relationships between entities and temporal information. By combining traditional vector search with knowledge graph capabilities, this agent can provide richer, more contextual responses that leverage both semantic similarity and entity relationships. This addresses the limitations of pure vector search by adding structured knowledge representation.

## What

- [x] Database connections (PostgreSQL with pgvector, Neo4j with Graphiti)
- [ ] REST API integrations (list required services)
- [x] File system operations

- ❌ Don't hardcode API keys - use environment variables for all credentials (✅ AVOIDED - .env.example provided)
- ❌ Don't ignore async patterns - Pydantic AI has specific async/sync requirements (✅ AVOIDED - consistent async)
- ❌ Don't create complex tool chains - keep tools focused and composable (✅ AVOIDED - simple tools)
- ❌ Don't skip error handling - implement comprehensive error handling (✅ AVOIDED - extensive error handling)

### RAG + Knowledge Graph Specific

- ❌ Don't ignore database connection lifecycle - use proper pooling and cleanup (✅ AVOIDED - AsyncPG pools)
- ❌ Don't mix vector formats - ensure consistent embedding representation (✅ AVOIDED - proper vector strings)
